**General things**

As I've explained, this mod will allow your isotope Sniper Rifle have a Purple color instead of the yucky green one that doesn't even match most skins nor match any Pro killstreak sheen or effect. Showcase reference is in the following link: https://imgur.com/a/pCytsAr and as for a video, it's based on the following mod: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acciw3qkBak

This is strictly only available on the Sniper Rifle. It will not change the isotope colors of other items such as the SMG or other unusual weapons I am able to recolor other unusual effects (i.e: the Scorching Flames becoming Purple instead of Green), but at the moment I am not considering it. The price I can roughly estimate for requests, considering the time it would take, would be 5-10 keys per particle edited, also depending on the complexity of the particle. Perhaps in the future I would be able to edit the actual speed, movements, or even add custom particles to replace some. But I highly doubt I will go that far.

**Please keep in mind that this mod will NOT work on some servers as they will have either sv_pure 2 or sv_pure 1. For example, Skial servers are a no-go. I personally have used flat texture mods on skial and they don't work. The same applies to the Isotope mod. However on UGC servers, it doesn't block it.**

**Also keep in mind that this mod only replaces the color from your perspective. Everyone else will see your isotope effect as the stock color. This will also mean that other isotopes will look purple, just like this one.**

**How to set it up and how it works**

The way to set this up is simply to extract the .ZIP file into your custom folder.
In the .ZIP file you will see a folder named "carlzaph_particles". If you go inside, it should have many ".pcf" files. These are Valve particle files, AKA the files which contain every unusual effect and other particles (such as the Classic laser) in them. There is also a .txt file named "particles_manifest". This is the file that allows the particles to manifest in the game itself. Take into account that deleting files in the .txt files just to "manifest" the purpleisotope.pcf file will remove all other particles, including unusual effects. This is because, although the Team Fortress 2 Directory has its vanilla particles hidden and recorded in a GCF file (which would usually run without no issue), the .ZIP file you have overrides the functions of the vanilla, stock game. This is, in other words, how HUDS work. They override the available content with custom content. 

Due to the nature of game updates, new unu effects, etc. the particles inside the .ZIP file will become outdated. This means some new unusual effects may not show, if you are using this mod that is, as the new particles aren't in the current mod's files. There is an easy fix to this, which is highlighted below. Apart from that, just extract the ZIP file into your custom folder and it should work in any sv_pure 0 server without any issues. In the case there is an issue (aka missing particles, the isotope not showing) please let me know.

**GCFScape (Nem's tools) and how to update your mod**

In the case that Valve releases a new update and also add new particles to the game, your mod wil need updating. For this, you will need to download GCFScape (https://nemstools.github.io/pages/GCFScape-Download.html). This allows you to access the aforementioned GCF files containing the unedited particles. You will open "item.fx" with GCFScape and it will take you to a "subdirectory" of what is inside the file. You will see various folders, but focus on the "particles" one. Open that, and you will see all the new particle files. All you have to do, is highlight all of them, extract them to the carzalph_particles folder and all of the old particles will be replaced and updated. The purpleisotope mod is what will remain. After this you only need to do one more thing. Since you've highlighted everything in the vanilla files, you will also have replaced the "particles_manifest.txt" file. All you really have to do is open the text file, and type !particlesmanifest ".../particles/purpleisotope.pcf" and save the changes so that the file will run the mod. The following imgur link is a rough step-by-step.
